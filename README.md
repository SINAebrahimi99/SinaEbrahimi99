# Sina Ebrahimi

Computer Science graduate student

Interested in Computer networking 🌐 and Cyber Security (Blue Side) 🔵

This GitHub page is a repository for my projects, Labs, and training.

And also a place to act as my second CV.

## About Me

I studied Math and Physics at Allameh Tabatabaei High School. 

after that, from 2018 to 2024, I continued my bachelor of education in Computer Science at Amir Kabir University of Technology (AUT)

yes 18 to 24 is long enough to get your masters degree but im not that smart

(and also some courses like "human in islam" and "Islamic thought" are hard to pass)
